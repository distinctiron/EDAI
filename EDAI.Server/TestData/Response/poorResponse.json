  "ArgumentationRecommendation": "Part 1: Recommendations\nYou can improve your arguments by explaining why your ideas are true. For example, if you say \u0027The lottery is bad,\u0027 tell us why it is bad – does it hurt people or make them sad? You can also add examples. For instance, say, \u0027In the story, Tessie is hurt, which shows how unfair the lottery is.\u0027 Finally, think about what others might say. If someone thinks the lottery is a fun game, what would you say back to them?\n\nPart 2: Targeted Exercises\nExercise 1 – Give Reasons: \nFinish these sentences by explaining why:\n1. The lottery is bad because…\n2. Following rules without thinking is not good because…\n3. Change can be good because…\n\nExercise 2 – Add an Example: \nRewrite this sentence with a real or made-up example:\n\u0027People in the village don’t care about Tessie.\u0027 → Try adding: \u0027For example, when she is picked, they throw stones at her instead of helping her.\u0027\n\nExercise 3 – Respond to a Different Opinion: \nImagine someone says: \u0027The lottery is exciting because it’s a tradition.\u0027 Write one sentence that shows what you think. You can start like this:\n\u0027I understand that, but the tradition hurts people, and that is not right.\u0027",
